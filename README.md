## Introduction

I created this game to run on my [ATtiny handheld games console](https://github.com/SeanP2001/ATtiny_Handheld_Games_Console). The game is a tribute to the original Snake game, featured on Nokia mobile phones at the turn of the millennium. 

Programming this game was a great way to practice using singly linked lists in C++. 

## Controls

| Button | Action                |
|:------:| --------------------- |
| Left   | Move the snake left   |
| Right  | Move the snake right  |
| Up     | Move the snake up     |
| Down   | Move the snake down   |

In order to control the snake you must press and hold the direction button until the snake updates it's position.

## Demonstration

## Credits

To create the game sounds I used the excellent code found [here](http://www.technoblogy.com/show?20MO) written by David Johnson-Davies. I highly recommend checking out David's website, especially for anything relating to the ATtiny microcontroller series.

## Further Work

In future I would like to:

- Add a directional pattern to the snake's body to make it clearer which direction it is moving.
- Add slimmer block sprites which help to clarify the snake's shape when parts run side by side with each other.
